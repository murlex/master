Dear lovely Joan! :)

Print every value from every json file in the folder recursively with help of exs.js script.
There is ex1 & ex2 already in the script as an example.
You have to figure out what will be printed first, write it in the comment before console.log() call and ONLY THEN you can 
test yourself by running this script with node.js
Hint: to run it, you can use Terminal window in MS Code and type: node exs.js

Enjoy :)

Ex8:
These are the events happened during football match.
Print on console:
1. What is 4th 'event' happened, who was the player, what minute it happened on
2. 8th 'event' on 79th minute print the team that got yellow card.

Ex9: 
a. Think of rich data model expressed as JSON that could represent the data about imaginary hospital patients.
Beside the basic data such as First Name, Last Name, ID etc. it should contains the information about hospitalization events
with dates, treating doctors, cures, procedures - anything you can think of. Be as creative as you can and don't worry if it
is not too professional or medical. Now, you are the architect. For this you create the file ex9.json. Make it contains
the information about three imaginary patients. As an example of please, see ex9.example.json file showing the possible 
model for school's students.

b. Add into exs.js the code printing all 2nd patient's basic data for all his/her hospitalizations.

c. Print total amount of times of patient's hospitalizations (e.g. 3). Hint: if you modeled hospitalizations as an array, you
can use "length" property.  

d. Print all the cures the patient was treated with during ALL his/her hospitalizations. Why it is not trivial? Think how you could write the code
for it.
