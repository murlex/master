Dear lovely Joan! :)

Print every value from every json file in the folder recursively with help of exs.js script.
There is ex1 & ex2 already in the script as an example.
You have to figure out what will be printed first, write it in the comment before console.log() call and ONLY THEN you can 
test yourself by running this script with node.js
Hint: to run it, you can use Terminal window in MS Code and type: node exs.js

Enjoy :)

Ex8:
These are the events happened during football match.
Print on console:
1. What is 4th 'event' happened, who was the player, what minute it happened on
2. 8th 'event' on 79th minute print the team that got yellow card.
